# Online Store Revenue Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes customer orders from an online store to provide insights into revenue generation. The dataset contains details of orders, including customer and product information, and the project focuses on calculating key revenue metrics and identifying top customers.

## Dataset

The dataset, `orders.csv`, includes the following columns:
- `order_id`: Unique identifier for each order
- `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `order_date`: Date when the order was placed
- `product_id`: Unique identifier for each product
- `product_name`: Name of the product
- `product_price`: Price of the product
- `quantity`: Quantity of the product ordered

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
1. **Monthly Revenue**: Compute the total revenue generated by the online store for each month.
2. **Product Revenue**: Compute the total revenue generated by each product.
3. **Customer Revenue**: Compute the total revenue generated by each customer.
4. **Top Customers**: Identify the top 10 customers by revenue generated.

## Implementation

The solution is implemented in Python, using the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. The code is structured to load the dataset, process the data, and output the required metrics.

### Key Features

- **Monthly Revenue Calculation**: Aggregates revenue on a monthly basis to show trends over time.
- **Product-wise Revenue Calculation**: Identifies the most profitable products.
- **Customer-wise Revenue Calculation**: Provides insights into customer spending patterns.
- **Top 10 Customers**: Lists the customers contributing the most to the revenue.

## Usage

1. **Prerequisites**: 
   - Python 3
   - pandas library

2. **Running the Code**:
   - Place the `orders.csv` file in the same directory as the script.
   - Run the script using a Python interpreter.

```bash
python tanx.py
```

3. **Output**:
   - The script outputs the total revenue by month, product, and customer.
   - It also lists the top 10 customers by revenue.

## Results

The results provide valuable insights into the revenue generation patterns of the online store, highlighting the most profitable periods, products, and customers.

## Future Work

Further analysis can include:
- Customer segmentation based on spending patterns.
