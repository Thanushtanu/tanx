# Online Store Revenue Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes customer orders from an online store to provide insights into revenue generation. The dataset contains details of orders, including customer and product information, and the project focuses on calculating key revenue metrics and identifying top customers.

## Dataset

The dataset, `orders.csv`, includes the following columns:
- `order_id`: Unique identifier for each order
- `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `order_date`: Date when the order was placed
- `product_id`: Unique identifier for each product
- `product_name`: Name of the product
- `product_price`: Price of the product
- `quantity`: Quantity of the product ordered

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
1. **Monthly Revenue**: Compute the total revenue generated by the online store for each month.
2. **Product Revenue**: Compute the total revenue generated by each product.
3. **Customer Revenue**: Compute the total revenue generated by each customer.
4. **Top Customers**: Identify the top 10 customers by revenue generated.

## Project Structure and Architecture

The project is structured into the following components:
- **Data**: Contains the dataset file `orders.csv`.
- **Scripts**: Contains the main script `analysis.py` that performs data analysis.
- **Docker**: Contains the `Dockerfile` and other necessary files to build and run the project in a Docker container.

### Key Components
- `analysis.py`: The main script for data analysis, including functions to calculate monthly revenue, product revenue, customer revenue, and identifying top customers.
- `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image configuration for the project.

## Implementation

The solution is implemented in Python, using the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. The code is structured to load the dataset, process the data, and output the required metrics.

### Key Features

- **Monthly Revenue Calculation**: Aggregates revenue on a monthly basis to show trends over time.
- **Product-wise Revenue Calculation**: Identifies the most profitable products.
- **Customer-wise Revenue Calculation**: Provides insights into customer spending patterns.
- **Top 10 Customers**: Lists the customers contributing the most to the revenue.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system

### Steps to Run the Project Using Docker

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/online-store-revenue-analysis.git
   cd online-store-revenue-analysis
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t revenue-analysis .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data revenue-analysis
   ```

   The `-v $(pwd)/data:/app/data` flag mounts the `data` directory from your local machine into the container, allowing the script to access the `orders.csv` file.

4. **View the Output**:
   The script will print the monthly revenue, product revenue, customer revenue, and the top 10 customers by revenue.

## Results

The results provide valuable insights into the revenue generation patterns of the online store, highlighting the most profitable periods, products, and customers.

## Future Work

Further analysis can include:
- Customer segmentation based on spending patterns.
- Predictive analytics for future sales trends.
- Analysis of customer churn and retention strategies.
